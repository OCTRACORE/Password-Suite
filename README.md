# Password-Suite
This is the computer science project by me and  Soumodeep Bhowmick for class 12.(The site is inactive now)
<p>This is a CRUD(create,update and delete) web app which allows the user to create a number of passwords based on their decision. The user gets the freedom of modifying the passwords generated, discarding them as well as organise them. Moreover, if required, the user can even save them in a file by encrypting them.They can refer them later through the program. The user interface is minimal 
enough for the users to use the program without any hassle. </p>
<p>The passwords are generated through the following steps. First, the program generates a random sets of alphabets, integers and special characters separately. Then, it 
creates different permutations of each of them and 
chooses one from each of them randomly.</p> 
<p>Finally, it 
concatenates all the chosen sets. Before that it generates different permutations of a combination of integers and special characters. 
Although the program generates passwords of fixed length, the user gets the freedom of increasing the length by editing them by their own. 
We have created the algorithm powerful and efficient enough to generate the passwords which are secure and difficult to crack.</p>
